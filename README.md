# Web Timers!

 This project was born out of a personal need: My phone only has one timer option and no option to save custom timers.
To solve this problem, I created a web app that allows the user to create multiple timers and save them to their device.
No more resetting a timer over and over, or only one timer at a time. I can now keep track of the time separately for the boiling pasta and the seitan I'm baking!
At the moment the app requires an internet connection to use, but I plan to offer an equal (or slightly simpler, depending on the possibilities offered by technology) option that works offline.
